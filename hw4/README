CS457/557 Functional Programming Winter 2020
Katie Casamento, Portland State University
Homework 4
Due before lecture (2pm) on Thursday, February 20.


1. ABOUT THIS PROJECT FOLDER

The folder containing this file is a Cabal project and also a Stack project.
The same commands from HW3 should work:

Cabal:
  Setup:
    cabal update
    cabal install --dependencies-only --enable-tests

  Test:
    cabal test

  Interpreter:
    cabal repl

Stack:
  Setup:
    stack update

  Test:
    stack test

  Interpreter:
    stack ghci
    (you might have to do ":l Foldables" to bring everything into scope)


2. ABOUT THIS HOMEWORK

This homework has you work with several key higher-kinded typeclasses from the
Haskell prelude: Foldable, Functor, and Applicative. In particular, the
Foldable typeclass is defined in terms of a function involving the Monoid
typeclass; much of the content of this assignment can be seen as generalizing
the last assignment's content to obtain versions of "mconcat" and related
operations that work over arbitrary "container" types instead of just lists.
The last question applies all of these concepts to the tic-tac-toe example from
assignment 1, implementing the Board type as a polymorphic container type.
